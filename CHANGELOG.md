### 0.14.1

__Date:__ May 27, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Update `zeroize` dependency.
- Improvements to documentation.

### 0.14.0

__Date:__ May 4, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- [Breaking change] Function `as_bytes()` for public newtypes are replaced with `AsRef<>` trait implementations. This means all `as_bytes()` calls need to be replaced with `as_ref()`.
- [Breaking change] The `SecretKey` for BLAKE2b is longer padded with zeroes to the length of the blocksize. Thus, the `SecretKey` no longer has a `get_original_length()` function, but the same result will be represented by the `get_length()` function instead.
- [Breaking change] All calls to `as_ref()` and `unprotected_as_bytes()` return the newtypes data with what it was initialized, regardless of padding. (With the exception of HMAC)
- [Breaking change] All calls to `get_length()` return the length of the newtype with what is what initialized, regardless of padding. (With the exception of HMAC)
- [Breaking change] All newtypes that offer `generate()` now panic if the RNG fails to initialize of read from its source. This also means that newtype `generate()` functions, that do not take in a size parameter, no longer return a `Result`.
- [Breaking change] `ValidationCryptoError` and `FinalizationCryptoError` have been removed. Though this doesn't mean that there is less information available, see [issue here](https://github.com/brycx/orion/issues/64).
- [Breaking change] Support for cSHAKE256 has been dropped, also meaning orion no longer depends on tiny-keccak. 8% decrease in `unsafe` code in dependencies.
- All fuzzing targets in `fuzz` that used libFuzzer have been deprecated in favor of those in [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/brycx/orion-fuzz) using honggfuzz-rs.
- Improvements to fuzzing targets in orion-fuzz.
- [Automated testing in CI, for constant-time execution](https://github.com/brycx/orion-dudect).
- Added `From<[u8; C]>` trait implementations for C-length fixed-sized newtypes, so that the caller may avoid using `Result` when not working with slices.
- [Breaking change] Module `hazardous::constants` has been removed and all types made private. Only a select number of constants have been re-exported in their respective modules. See [here for more information](https://github.com/brycx/orion/pull/72).
- It is now strictly advised agianst using orion in debug mode, for what is meant to be production use. Using `opt-level = 0` with orion, is also advised against. See [security section](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki/Security#release-and-codegen-options).
- `rand_os` has been replaced with `getrandom`.
- Improvements to documentation examples as they no longer use `.unwrap()` but `?` instead.

### 0.13.4

__Date:__ April 1, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Fix build for latest nightly.

### 0.13.3

__Date:__ March 31, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Updated `zeroize` to `0.6.0`.
- Added a small number of tests.
- Improvement to constant-time interfaces ([#66](https://github.com/brycx/orion/pull/66)).

### 0.13.2

__Date:__ March 13, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- PBKDF2 and BLAKE2b now panic on lengths exceeding (2^32-1) * 64 and 2*(2^64-1), respectively.
- ChaCha20 length constrictions are now equivalent to those of the RFC and panics on trying to process more than 2^32-1 keystream blocks.
- Documentation improvements.
- OpenSSL test vectors for BLAKE2b.

__Note__: Strictly speaking, the first two changes are breaking, but because of the unlikeliness that this has an effect on anybody, they were not marked as such.

### 0.13.1

__Date:__ February 16, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Documentation improvements ([#60](https://github.com/brycx/orion/issues/60)).

### 0.13.0

__Date:__ February 10, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- [Breaking change]: `orion::hazardous::hash::sha512` previously used the same `Digest` as BLAKE2b. This is no longer the case, making it impossible to specify a non fixed-length hash as `Digest` with SHA512.
- [Breaking change]: `HLEN` constant renamed to `SHA512_OUTSIZE` and `SHA2_BLOCKSIZE` constant renamed to `SHA512_BLOCKSIZE`.
- Added `POLY1305_OUTSIZE` constant.
- Improved documentation for high-level `Password`, `SecretKey` in `hazardous`s `hmac` and `blake2b`, as well as `Password` in `pbkdf2` of `hazardous`.
- Added AppVeyor builds and testing for Windows MSVC with Visual Studio 2017.

### 0.12.6 [Yanked]

__Date:__ February 8, 2019.

### 0.12.5 [Yanked]

__Date:__ February 4, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Refactored HMAC and improved performance for PBKDF2 by ~50%.
- Removed `byteorder` dependency using instead the endianness conversion functions that came with Rust 1.32.

### 0.12.4 [Yanked]

__Date:__ January 31, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Fixes a bug where hashing, with BLAKE2b, over 2^64-1 bytes of data would cause an overflowing addition on debug builds.
- Fixes a bug where hashing, with SHA512, over 2^64-1 bytes of data would not result in the counter being correctly incremented.
- Added property-based testing, using QuickCheck, to most of the library and improved testing for the library in general.
- `PartialEq` is now implemented for `orion::kdf::Salt` and `Nonce` in both `chacha20` and `xchacha20`.
- Added `get_length()` for `blake2b::Digest`.
- Updated fuzzing dependencies.

### 0.12.3 [Yanked]

__Date:__ January 29, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Improved compilation time.

__Date:__ January 26, 2019.

__Changelog:__

### 0.12.1 [Yanked]

__Date:__ January 16, 2019.

__Changelog:__

- Switched `rand` dependency out with `rand_os`.

### 0.12.0 [Yanked]

__Date:__ December 29, 2018.

__Changelog:__

- [Breaking change]: All high-level functions now return a Result.
- [Breaking change]: `Password` in `pbkdf2`, `SecretKey` and `hmac()` of `hmac` and `extract()` of `hkdf` in `hazardous` now return a Result. 
- [Breaking change]: Limit all `generate()` taking a `length` parameter, and `orion::kdf` calls to a length of less than `u32::max_value()` as maximum.
- [Breaking change]: `orion::kdf` and `orion::pwhash` take a new `Password` parameter that is heap-allocated and returns a Result.
- Removed `sha2` dependency and `ring` dev-dependency. `sha2` has been replaced with orion's own SHA512 implementation.
- Added support for BLAKE2b and SHA512.
- Updated to Rust 2018 Edition.
- Better performance for HMAC, HKDF and PBKDF2.
