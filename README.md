### About
orion is a cryptography library written in pure Rust. It aims to provide easy and usable crypto while trying to minimize the use of unsafe code. You can read more about orion in the [wiki](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki).

Currently supports:
* **AEAD**: (X)ChaCha20Poly1305.
* **Stream ciphers**: (X)ChaCha20.
* **KDF**: HKDF-HMAC-SHA512, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512.
* **MAC**: HMAC-SHA512, Poly1305.
* **Hashing**: BLAKE2b, SHA512.

### Security
This library has **not undergone any third-party security audit**. Usage is at **own risk**.

More information about security regarding orion is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki/Security).

### Minimum Supported Rust Version
Rust 1.37 or later is supported however, the majority of testing happens with latest stable Rust.

MSRV may be changed at any point and will not be considered a SemVer breaking change.

### Crate Features
By default orion targets stable Rust and in this case, extra dependency specifications are not required.

To use orion in a `no_std` context, you need to specify the dependency as such:
```
orion = { version = "*", default-features = false }
# Replace * with the most recent version
```

When orion is used in a `no_std` context, access to nearly all functionality, except for that in
`hazardous`, is not available. This is because the high-level functionality depends on the systems random generator,
which is not available in `no_std`.

### Documentation
Can be viewed [here](https://docs.rs/orion) or built with:

```
cargo doc --no-deps
```

### Tests and Fuzzing
The [wiki](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki/Testing-suite) has details on how orion is tested. To run all tests:
```
cargo test
```

Fuzzing is done using [honggfuzz-rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs) in [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/brycx/orion-fuzz). See [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/brycx/orion-fuzz) on how to start fuzzing orion.

Constant-time execution tests can be found at [orion-dudect](https://github.com/brycx/orion-dudect) and [orion-sidefuzz](https://github.com/brycx/orion-sidefuzz).

### Benchmarks
The library can be benchmarked with [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) as below. All benchmarking tests are located in `benches/`.
```
cargo bench
```
